For an advanced computer vision project with a comprehensive tutorial, I recommend working on Autonomous Driving Car Simulation. This project is not only complex and engaging but also highly relevant to current technological trends. It covers various aspects of computer vision and deep learning, such as lane detection, object detection, and traffic sign recognition.

Project: Autonomous Driving Car Simulation
Components of the Project
Lane Detection: Identifying and tracking the lanes on the road.
Object Detection: Detecting and classifying objects such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
Traffic Sign Recognition: Recognizing and interpreting traffic signs.
Path Planning and Control: Planning the driving path and controlling the simulated vehicle.
Tutorial: Step-by-Step Guide
1. Set Up the Environment
Install Python and necessary libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow keras
Use a simulation environment like Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator or CARLA Simulator.
2. Lane Detection
Tutorial Reference: Lane Detection using OpenCV and Python
Steps:
Capture video frames from the simulator.
Convert the frames to grayscale.
Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
Use Canny edge detection to highlight edges.
Define a region of interest and apply a mask.
Use Hough transform to detect lane lines.
Draw the lane lines on the original frame.
3. Object Detection
Tutorial Reference: YOLO Object Detection with OpenCV and Python
Steps:
Download YOLO pre-trained weights and configuration files.
Load YOLO model using OpenCV.
Capture video frames and preprocess them.
Run the YOLO model on the frames to detect objects.
Draw bounding boxes around detected objects.
4. Traffic Sign Recognition
Tutorial Reference: Traffic Sign Classification with Deep Learning in Python
Steps:
Download a traffic sign dataset (e.g., German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).
Preprocess the images (resize, normalize).
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification.
Train the CNN on the traffic sign dataset.
Integrate the model to recognize signs from video frames.
5. Path Planning and Control
Tutorial Reference: Path Planning for Self-Driving Cars
Steps:
Use a path planning algorithm (e.g., A* or Dijkstra) to determine the driving path.
Implement a PID controller to adjust the steering angle based on lane detection and object positions.
Continuously update the path and control signals as new frames are processed.
6. Integration and Testing
Integrate all components (lane detection, object detection, traffic sign recognition, path planning, and control) into a single pipeline.
Test the system in the simulator to ensure all components work together seamlessly.
Fine-tune the models and control parameters based on performance in the simulation.
